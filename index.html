    <B><h1><mark>CYBER CRIME</mark></h1></B>
    <p><h3>Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device.<br>

        Most, but not all, cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money. Cybercrime is carried out by individuals or organizations.<br>
        
        Some cybercriminals are organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers.<br>
        
        Rarely, cybercrime aims to damage computers for reasons other than profit. These could be political or personal.</h3></p>
    <b><h1><mark>Types of cybercrime</mark></h1></b>
    <p><h4>Here are some specific examples of the different types of cybercrime:</h4>

        Email and internet fraud.<br>
        Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used). <br>
        Theft of financial or card payment data. <br>
        Theft and sale of corporate data. <br>
        Cyberextortion (demanding money to prevent a threatened attack).
        Ransomware attacks (a type of cyberextortion). <br>
        Cryptojacking (where hackers mine cryptocurrency using resources they do not own). <br>
        Cyberespionage (where hackers access government or company data). <br>
        <h4>Most cybercrime falls under two main categories:</h4>
        
        Criminal activity that targets <br>
        Criminal activity that uses computers to commit other crimes. <br> 
        Cybercrime that targets computers often involves viruses and other types of malware.<br>
        
        Cybercriminals may infect computers with viruses and malware to damage devices or stop them working. They may also use malware to delete or steal data.</p>
